# âœ‹ Hand Gesture Recognition using OpenCV + KNN

> A lightweight hand gesture recognition system using OpenCV and KNN without deep learning frameworks.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim

Develop a system that recognizes hand gestures from a webcam in real-time.

---

## ðŸ“„ Description

This project allows a user to:
- Collect hand gesture images using their webcam
- Train a gesture recognition model using **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- Predict hand gestures (like numbers 0â€“5) live using OpenCV

All done **without TensorFlow or Keras**, making it simple and fast to run.

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

- Real-time video processing using OpenCV
- Image preprocessing: ROI extraction, grayscale conversion, resizing
- Applying classical ML (KNN) for image classification
- Working with camera streams and prediction overlays

---

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- scikit-learn (KNN classifier)
- NumPy
